# custom-css-learnit

Created by [Frederik Petersen](https://github.com/fredpetersen) and [Lucas Hanson](https://github.com/lucasfth)

## Reason for creation of this repo

LearnIT now looks like shit.\
We have therefore now started to create custom CSS to mimic the old UI.

## Files

There are different CSS files that will change different parts of LearnIT. 
You can choose to copy all of the CSS into a single file that an extension can use to override the default LearnIT or take some part of the code instead.

The CSS in [global.css](https://github.com/lucasfth/custom-css-learnit/blob/main/global.css) will affect LearnIT globally.\
[dashboard.css](https://github.com/lucasfth/custom-css-learnit/blob/main/dashboard.css) only affects the dashboard*.\
[all-courses.css](https://github.com/lucasfth/custom-css-learnit/blob/main/all-courses.css) only affects the all course page*.

*I think

## Arc Browser
If you use the Arc browser then you can grab [this](https://arc.net/boost/E4DEFEC3-EA73-46F9-9E64-77937932DEE8) boost instead.
