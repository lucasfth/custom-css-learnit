# custom-css-learnit

LearnIT now looks like shit.\
I have therefore now started to create custom CSS to fix some of the visual problems

The CSS in [global.css](https://github.com/lucasfth/custom-css-learnit/blob/main/global.css) will affect LearnIT globally.\
[dashboard.css](https://github.com/lucasfth/custom-css-learnit/blob/main/dashboard.css) only affects the dashboard.
